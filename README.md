# Browser Detector v1.0.0
A simple tool to detect old browsers and notify users that they might experience some problems.

### How to use

The first step is to include the javascript file with the desired version on the `<head>` tag so that it gets loaded before any other content:

```html
<script src="//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/mindera-bd-test/1.0.0/detector.min.js"></script>
```

If you wish to always include the latest version just don't specify it:

```html
<script src="//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/mindera-bd-test/detector.min.js"></script>
```

Then you need to initialize, anywhere on the `<body>`, the detector with the browsers and the browser versions you want to compare e.g.:

```javascript
window.bdetector.detector({
    vs: {i: 9, f: 40, s: 6, c: 50}
});
```

After that, if the user is on an older browser version than the specified, the user will receive a notification with the information that some errors may occur.


### How to develop
Run this command to update the file generated by webpack on the `dist` folder:

```sh
npm run build
```

Run this command to update and minimize the file generated by webpack on the `dist` folder:

```sh
npm run production
```

### How to deploy
You will need to have the following environment variables set up:

- *DETECTOR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY*
- *DETECTOR_AWS_SECRET_KEY*
- *DETECTOR_AWS_BUCKET*

Before you deploy make sure you bump the version number appropriately first with the command:

```sh
npm version major|minor|patch
```

Then run the command below to deploy the file generated by webpack on the `dist` folder:
- Running this also runs the `production` command so your code is always minified when deployment happens.

```sh
npm run deploy
```
